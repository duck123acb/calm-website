              To minimize time wastage, I mainly worked on the chassis/overall assembly, and Kevin took care of the electrical side. The biggest challenges we faced were fitting the screws into the 3d printed parts, and sometimes reading the instructions. However, we would always help each other where we could. The biggest thing I learned was that in order to be efficient, you have to rely on and help your teammates the best you can. Overall, the project taught me the importance of teamwork and clear communication when solving technical problems.
