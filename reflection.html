          <strong>What are the 3 most important lessons we covered?</strong>
          <p>Three of the most valuable lessons learned in CALM 20 were Credit and Debt, Resumes, and Dimensions of Wellness and Stress. I chose credit and debt because financial literacy is a critical component of adulthood. Secondly, the lesson on resumes was also significant as I will be looking for opportunities in technology as well as my other passions in the near future. Knowing how to properly construct a resume will give me an advantage when applying for part-time jobs, co-ops, and internships. Lastly, the lesson about wellness and stress is important for me, not just in the future, but also now because of the upcoming exams</p>
          <br>
          <strong>Identify the 3 areas / lessons in which you feel you need to grow or improve most.</strong>
          <p>The three areas I could improve on the most are: wellness and stress, multiple intelligences, and time management. The main reason I need to work on all of these is because of the lack of implementation in my life. I just need to sit down and look at how I can incorporate as as many of the aspects of each as possible in my life. Improving in these areas would help me stay more balanced, motivated, and efficient in both school and personal goals. Even small changes, like setting a schedule or practicing mindfulness, could make a big difference in how I manage my time and energy.</p>

          <strong>How has CALM 20 supported the development and maintenance of your own transferable skills?</strong>
          <p>CALM 20 supported the development and maintenance of your own transferable skills mainly by making me aware of these skills giving me tips on how to improve them. For example: time management. Before, I had an idea that my time management was terrible, but since we discussed it in class, simply becoming more aware of the problem has actually helped (at least a little).</p>

      <h2>Future Ready Skills</h2>
      <div class="section text-t">
          <div class="text">
          <strong>Describe how you have progressed in each Future Ready Skill (Responsibility, Organization, Independent Work, and Self Regulation)</strong>
          <p>With organization, I think I have actually regressed in the sense that I sometimes show up late to class when before I was always on time. With responsibility, I feel I have reinforced the habits I already had, leading to an increase in productivity and getting things done on time. For independent work, I feel that I am the same as I was when writing the mid-year reflection: using class time effectively, and putting my best effort when completing assignments. With self-regulation, I do all the same things I mentioned in the mid-year reflection, but I find that I don't need to ask as many questions. This may be indicative of a better ability to understand things, or it could also just be a coincidence.</p>
          <br>
          <strong>Selecting 2 of these Future Ready Skills, how might you further improve in these areas for Grade 11?</strong>
          <p>To further improve in organization for Grade 11, I will to develop a more stable routine with an even better reminder setting system and practicing consistency. This should help me arrive to class on time and manage my tasks more efficiently. For self-regulation, I want to continue building my ability to stay focused and reduce distractions during work time. I can do so by setting personal short-term goals during each work period and assessing which methods were most productive afterward, learning even more for better self-management of my life.</p>
