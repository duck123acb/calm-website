              This circuit is a regulated power supply for an Arduino project, built
              around two voltage regulators. The input comes from a DC power jack,
              which first passes through a diode to protect against reverse polarity.
              A 100 ÂµF capacitor smooths the input voltage before it enters the first
              regulator, which outputs 5V. This 5V line can be used to directly power
              Arduino boards or other peripherals. From the 5V rail, another regulator
              steps the voltage down further to 3.3V, filtered by capacitors (100 nF
              each) to stabilize the output and reduce noise. Additionally, a battery
              pack is shown as an alternative supply source. Together, these components
              ensure that the Arduino receives clean, regulated 5V and 3.3V supplies
              needed for its microcontroller and sensors.

              This circuit is built around the ATmega328P microcontroller. It includes
              the essential components needed for the chip to operate: a 16 MHz crystal
              oscillator with capacitors for clock stability, a reset circuit with a
              pull-up resistor, and decoupling capacitors to ensure clean power delivery.
              Power is supplied through the VCC and AVCC pins, while AREF provides a
              reference voltage for analog-to-digital conversions. Communication and
              programming are supported through UART (TX/RX pins) combined with an ICSP
              connector and a crystal oscillator for serial communication.

              This circuit allows the microcontroller to connect to a computer, reset,
              and provide feedback through LEDs. At the heart of this section is the
              USB-to-Serial chip (ATmega16U2), which converts USB signals from the
              computer into serial data the Arduino's main microcontroller can
              understand. A reset circuit made up of a push button, a resistor, and a
              transistor lets the user or computer restart the board when uploading new
              code. A small capacitor helps filter noise so the reset signal is clean
              and reliable. Several LEDs are also included: one shows when the board is
              powered on, another blinks when data is being transmitted (TX), another
              when data is received (RX), and the LED tied to pin 13 is available for
              user testing.
