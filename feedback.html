          <strong>Feedback</strong>
          <p>
            The feedback challenged my initial thoughts about the interview. I believed I had done well in presenting my qualifications, but I didn't realize how important it is to actively show enthusiasm. After reflecting, I see how important energy and interest are in making a positive impression. Moving forward, this feedback has made me more aware of my nonverbal communication and tone, and I'm more committed to showing genuine interest in future interviews.

          <strong>Next Steps</strong>
          <p>
            In general the main thing I should do is practice showing enthusiasm. I should:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Practice mock interviews with a friend or a mirror and focus on using more facial expressions (like smiling) and an energetic tone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Record myself answering questions and adjust myself accordingly
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
